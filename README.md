This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in PHP when using `func_get_args()` to handle variable-length arguments in functions. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to access an array index that might be out of bounds. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version, using `isset()` or `count()` to safely handle the arguments and avoid undefined index errors.  This is a crucial aspect of writing robust and error-free PHP code.
